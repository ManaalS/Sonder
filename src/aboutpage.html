  <p> Hi! Our names are Manaal Siddiqui, Emily Su, Ruqia Mohammad, and Diraj Magar, and we're the team behind this website. This was our project for a hackathon called Cal Hacks (the coolest hackathon ever), and we affectionately call it "Sonder." "Sonder" refers to the feeling that one experiences when they realize that everyone has a life as complex as their own, and as complex as the next. We wanted to help our fellow college students who have super stressful, chaotic lives micromanage and analyze their thoughts while building healthy self-introspective habits. We hope you like our project :) </p>
