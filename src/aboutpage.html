  <p> Hi! Our names are Manaal Siddiqui, Emily Su, Ruqia Mohammad, and Diraj Magar, and we're the team behind this website. This is our project for a hackathon called Cal Hacks (the coolest hackathon ever!), and we affectionately call it "Claricity." This project is designed to help our fellow college students declutter their minds by being cognizant of negative self-talk and reflecting on their thinking habits. We hope this will aid any efforts to attain mental clarity. :) </p>
